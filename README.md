# Stress Testing: Predicting Loss under Adverse Economic Conditions

This repository includes the code used to perform stress testing based on economic scenarios using loan portfolio. The application was originally done on [```MATLAB```](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/67771-stress-testing-predicting-loss-under-adverse-economic-conditions) and we extended it to the open-source ```Python``` programming language.

## Prerequisites

The ```Python``` programming language, version 4.2.0, and its statistical and machine learning libraries were used to build all applied models. The ```R``` script _packages.R_ in the _packages_ folder installs and loads all necessary ```R``` packages. 

All operations, from data preprocessing to model estimation, were carried out on the Google Colaboratory platform.

## Theoretical Background
